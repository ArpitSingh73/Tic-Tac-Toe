# Tic-Tac-Toe

Plat at :- https://arpitsingh73.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/


A simple but very fundamental project for the understanding of ReactJs. It is east to pass props to children in downward direction (by Context API, Redux or by directly), and render the changes according to the parent components but, updating the parents as per changes in children or components far from each other was the main crux of this project. In this project I learned and implemented :-
State uplifting ✔
Rendering changes of children components in parent components ✔
ReactJS ✔
JavasScript ✔
etc.


The code is also provided in ReactJs documentation for conceptual understanding.
